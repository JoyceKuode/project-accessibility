# project-accessibility
A project with design focused on accessibility

The purpose of this project was to create a web experience that prioritizes accessibility, ensuring it meets the needs of all users. My awareness of the technological challenges faced by blind individuals began over 10 years ago when I spent time with Stevie Wonder. I was impressed with his ability to use screen readers to receive and send his own text messages and emails. Thinking about Stevie also made me think of the harpejji, the instrument that made it possible for me to say that I influenced Stevie Wonder's music career. ðŸ˜…

I wanted to work on a project that I felt personally connected to and that could serve a real-world purpose. This project blends the themes of promoting an instrument that is ergonomically friendly for blind individuals and ensuring the information reaches as many people as possible, with or without disabilities. 

Starting with a mission statement and old photos, I really tried to present the story in a personal way. Initially, I was inspired by scrollytelling and parallax web designs, but I opted for a simpler fade-in effect on scroll using JavaScript, styled to tell a story in small chapters. 

I used high contrast colors in my color scheme, changing the background color at each "chapter" to make sections more distinct and digestible. I focused on semantic HTML and incorporated ARIA labels and alt texts for icons, buttons, and images. I also added a scroll-to-top button so that users who navigate with a keyboard can quickly return to the navigation buttons in the header and access specific parts of the page. I used Silktide, Lighthouse, and Funkify extensions to run various tests for accessibility. I also experienced my page useing a screen reader.

If I had more time, I would further enhance the accessibility design, perhaps by adding options for larger text sizes or an alternate color scheme.
