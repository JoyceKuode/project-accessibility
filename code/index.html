        <h1>A New Instrument with Untapped Potential</h1>

        <p>It was winter 2012, and I was a local musician fortunate enough to attend the National
          Association of Music Merchants(NAMM), an invitation-only trade show where musicians and industry insiders
          gather to experience the latest in musical innovation.</p>

        <p>As I wandered through the bustling aisles, filled with
          sounds of new and exciting instruments, I stumbled across a new instrument I had never seen before: the
          harpejji. At first glance, it looked like a cross between a piano and a guitar. Its design immediately
          intrigued me, so I decided to give it a try. I was drawn to the instrument's unique blend of tactile
          interaction and beautiful sound. I had a feeling that this was more than just another instrument, but it had
          real potential to break new ground in music</p>
