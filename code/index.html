      <p>I'm a guitarist, web developer, and a passionate advocate for spreading awareness about the harpejji, an
        extraordinary and versatile electric stringed instrument.</p>
      <p>I'm not a representative of the company who manufactures the instrument. I'm just a musician who had
        the incredible opportunity to share it with a legend.
        Here's how it all happened, and how the harpejji could inspire you too.</p>

    <!-- The Story -->
    <article>

      <!-- Section 1: Harpejji Discovery -->
      <section id="intro" class="fade-in-section section-1">
        <h1>A New Instrument with Untapped Potential</h1>

        <p>It was winter 2012, and I was just a local musician who was fortunate enough to attend the National
          Association of Music Merchants (NAMM), an invitation-only trade show where musicians and industry insiders
          gather to experience the latest in musical innovation.</p>

        <figure class="polaroid">

          <figcaption>Tim Meeks, the inventor of the harpejji, and me after my first experience with this amazing
            instrument</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As I wandered through the bustling aisles, I stumbled across an instrument I had never seen before: the
          harpejji. Its design immediately
          caught my eye, so I decided to give it a try. I was drawn to the instrument's unique blend of tactile
          interaction and beautiful sound and I had a feeling that it had
          real potential to break new ground in music.</p>

      <!-- Section 2: Stevie Wonder Encounter -->
      <section class="fade-in-section section-2">
        <h1>An Unexpected Encounter with Stevie Wonder</h1>
        <figure class="polaroid">
          <img src="./assets/stevie-encounter.jpg" alt="The author meeting Stevie Wonder for the first time">

        </figure>
        <p>Later that day, I found myself chatting with someone connected to Stevie Wonder's inner circle. Before long,
          I was within earshot of the legend himself as he played a hammer dulcimer and expressed his desire to
          feel more connected to the strings. It was in that moment that I felt compelled to speak up and ask if he
          had
          ever played the harpejji. He hadn't heard of it, but Stevie was intrigued and insisted I take him to this new
          instrument so he could try it out
          for himself.</p>

      <section class="fade-in-section section-3">
        <h1>Stevie's Connection to the Harpejji</h1>
        <p>Watching Stevie Wonder play the harpejji for the first time was a surreal experience. As soon as his fingers
          touched the strings, it was clear that the instrument spoke to him in a way that few others had. It offered
          the direct, tactile connection he had been seeking, and his excitement was infectious.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Stevie had a custom harpejji made for him, and the instrument became a major part of
          his songwriting, recording, and performing.</p>

        <h1>The Power of Spreading Good Information</h1>

          <figcaption>Stevie and I in his hotel room after he played the harpejji for me and his assistant.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The story of the harpejji and Stevie Wonder is testament to the power of sharing knowledge. Sometimes all it
          takes is connecting the right person with the right tool to create something extraordinary. Watching an artist
          like Stevie incorporate the harpejji into his work
          showed me how powerful a single idea, or a single introduction, can be.

      <!-- Section 5: Bringing the Harpejji to More People -->
      <section class="fade-in-section section-1">
        <h1>An Instrument Worthy of More Attention</h1>
        <figure class="polaroid">
          <img src="./assets/stevies-harpejji.jpg" alt="Stevie Wonder's harpejji">
          <figcaption>Stevie's custom-built harpejji features a braille marker for every C note, an "S" for Stevie, and
            his name in braille.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>One challenge with the harpejji is that it is made to order and not something you can easily find in
          stores, so it remains somewhat under the radar. That's why I've made it my mission to help more people
          discover this remarkable instrument. </p>
        <p>It's not just about shining a spotlight on the harpejji; it's about ensuring that everyone - especially those
          who may not have access to traditional instruments - has the opportunity to connect with their music in new,
          innovative ways.</p>

        <p>Looking back on that day at NAMM and everything that followed, I'm proud to have played a small role in the
          story of the harpejji, and I'm excited to see where it goes
          next. The instrument has already changed music for one legend, and I believe it can do the same for many
          others.</p>
