    <h1>How I Influenced Stevie Wonder's Music Career: A True Story About Impacting a Legend</h1>
    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>My name is Joyce Kuo, and this is a story about the time I met Stevie Wonder - an encounter that would influence
      his music in a way I could never have predicted.</p>
    <p>It was winter 2012, and I was a humble local musician who was fortuante enough to attend NAMM, an invitation-only
      trade show where musicians and industry insiders gather to experience the latest in musical innovation. </p>

      <h1>A Serendipitous Discovery</h1>
      <p>As I walked through the bustling halls of NAMM, surrounded by all the latest and greatest in music technology,
        I stumbled across an instrument I had never seen before. As a musician with experience in both guitar and piano,
        I was immediately captivated by its design, which seemed to blend elements of both instruments. Naturally, I
        decided to give it a try. </p>
